<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview


Took this on as I wanted to see where I am at the moment with my progress. Found my weaknesses, I think I struggled more than expected. Need to work a lot of positioning of elements, looked fine offline once deployed it was massively shifted over to the right. I had to go back and find my mistakes and redeploy. You live and learn.
